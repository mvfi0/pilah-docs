# Work Log

What was done, when, and how long it took.

**How durations are measured:** from the timestamps of the Claude Code session and the commits, grouped into blocks separated by gaps of more than 45 minutes. Times are WIB. Rows marked *self-reported* use my own estimate instead. The log covers hands-on development work; meetings, the daily scrum and offline reading are not included.
